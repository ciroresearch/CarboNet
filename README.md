DESCRIPTION OF SCRIPTS:
_FullStateFdbk_arbitraryRates_ (Python notebook): Generates the paper results in the case of full-state feedback control and arbitrary rate constants.
_FullStateFdbk_CO2case_ (Python notebook): Generates the paper results in the case of full-state feedback control and tropospheric CO2 control for climate stability.
_outputFdbk_arbitraryRates_ (MATLAB script): Generates the paper results in the case of output-feedback control and arbitrary rate constants. Note that the functions "algorithm1" and "algorithm2" must be downloaded from this repository: https://codeocean.com/capsule/4291166/tree/v1. We thank Adrian Ilka and Nikolce Murgovski for sharing those codes.
